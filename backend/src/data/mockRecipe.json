  "cuisine": "American",
  "level": "Easy",
  "ingredients": [
    "50g (about 7) soft ready-to-eat dried apricots (we used Crazy Jack organic, because they are sulphur-free)",
    "Â½ tbsp rapeseed oil",
    "3 large eggs, whites only (see tip to use up the yolks)"
  ],
  "method": [
    "Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line a large baking tray with baking parchment.",
    "Tip the apricots, oil and egg whites into a bowl (see tip box for how to use up the egg yolks), then blitz with a hand blender until very smooth. Stir in the oats, cinnamon and vanilla, then fold through the desiccated coconut, almonds and pumpkin seeds.",
    "Pinch clusters of the mixture together to create texture in the granola, then scatter over the lined baking tray in a single layer. Bake for 15 mins, then toss (turning the larger pieces) and bake for a further 10 mins until golden and crunchy."
